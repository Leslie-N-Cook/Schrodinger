# Schrodinger
1D schrodinger equation


This program shows the solution for programming Schrodinger's equation in 1-dimension. 
The Schrodinger equation is a linear partial differential that determines the wavefunction of a quantum system.
The kinetic and potential energies are transformed into the Hamiltonian.
The Hamiltonian extracts the eigenvalues in terms of Energy from the eigenfunction.
The Shrodinger equation gives the form of the wavefunction in terms of quantized energy that allow us to calculate other properties in a time-independent system..
